## Hi 👋,

My name is Abiola pka Fab. I am a graduate of Computer Science(2019)👨🏽‍🎓 and a Fullstack Software Developer 👨🏽‍💻.
 
- 🔭 I’m currently doing fullstack developement with Vue JS and Laravel ❤️.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GO, React, Spring Boot and improving on my Laravel/Vue skills.
- 💻👯 I’m looking to work on awesome product(s) where I get to apply my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team and impact millions of lives positively.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Chess, Monopoly and I would love to explore new places, cultures, and definitely learn a new language.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Gmail](mailto:abiolafakorede@gmail.com)

## {...} My Stack 💻🚀

```
{
  languages: ['PHP', 'Python', 'Java', 'JavaScript', 'GO'],
  backend: ['Laravel', 'Django', 'Node.js'],
  database: ['MySql, PostgresSQL', 'MongoDB', 'Redis'],
  frontend: ['jQuery', 'Vue JS', 'React']
}
```

Although, while I have a understanding of frontend frameworks and can work in a Fullstack role, I'm preferrably a Backend developer 🚀.
